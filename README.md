# Uncommon Shell Script Bug: Loop Iteration and Filename Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a shell script related to loop iteration and filename handling. The script processes a list of files, but its handling of filenames with spaces and special characters is flawed, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior. The solution provides improved robustness and error handling.

## Bug Description
The original script contains a simple loop that iterates over a list of files. The problem arises when filenames include spaces or special characters. The loop does not handle these cases correctly, potentially resulting in incorrect processing or script failure.

## Solution
The solution focuses on improving the handling of filenames using more robust techniques. By using array indexing and appropriate quoting, the script can handle files with spaces and special characters correctly. Furthermore, input validation and error handling are added to improve the script's reliability.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `bug.sh` script.  Observe the incorrect behavior.
3. Run the `bugSolution.sh` script.  Observe the correct behavior.
