# This script attempts to process a list of files, but contains a subtle error.
# It uses a loop to iterate over the files, but the loop condition is incorrect.

  echo "Processing: $i"
  # ... some file processing logic would go here...
done

# The error is that it doesn't handle files with spaces in their names correctly.
# Also, it's not robust against unexpected input. 
# Consider a scenario where a file path might contain special character(s).
